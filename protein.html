        <h3>Protein</h3>
        <p>
          Protein plays a vital role in muscle growth, repair, and retention. It helps your body recover after workouts,
          supports lean muscle development, and keeps you feeling full longer. Adequate protein intake is especially
          important when losing weight or increasing physical activity, as it helps preserve muscle mass while promoting
          fat loss.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Recommended daily intake:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Women:</strong> about 46 grams per day</li>
          <li><strong>Men:</strong> about 56 grams per day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For active individuals or those aiming to build muscle, daily needs may be higher—around
          <strong>0.8 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="supplement-card">
        <h3>Creatine</h3>
        <p>
          Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that helps your muscles produce energy during
          high-intensity exercise. It supports strength, endurance, and faster recovery after workouts.
          Beyond physical performance, creatine also benefits brain health by improving focus, memory,
          and mental clarity. Whether your goal is to enhance your workouts or support overall cognitive
          function, creatine can help your body and mind perform at their best.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Recommended daily intake:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Women:</strong> about 3–5 grams per day</li>
            <li><strong>Men:</strong> about 3–5 grams per day</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="supplement-card">
        <h3>Magnesium</h3>
        <p>
          Magnesium plays a key role in hundreds of processes throughout the body, including energy production,
          muscle function, and nerve signaling. It helps reduce muscle cramps, supports quality sleep,
          and promotes relaxation. Magnesium also contributes to heart health, balanced blood sugar levels,
          and healthy digestion, making it an important nutrient for overall well-being and recovery.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Recommended daily intake:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Women:</strong> about 310–320 mg per day</li>
            <li><strong>Men:</strong> about 400–420 mg per day</li>
