        <p>MyFitnessPal makes calorie tracking and nutrition awareness very accessible: you log your
          meals (manually or via database/search), track your exercise or activity, set calorie &
          macronutrient targets, and monitor your progress over time. The large food database,
          cross-device syncing (mobile + web), and habit-building of logging help you understand
          what you’re eating and how it aligns with your goals. The paid version is ad-free,
          allows for setting macronutrient goals by gram versus percentage, sets food timestamps,
          has a voice-logging feature, meal scans, and allows for custom exercise-calorie settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Premium pricing for MyFitnessPal is either $24.99 a month, or an annual plan that is
          $99.99 billed once a year (which works out to be around $8.34 per month).

          track exercise or activity to see how it all affects your daily calorie “budget”.
          That constant logging and awareness helps you understand where your calories are going,
          make better choices, and stay consistent, which is the foundation of sustainable weight
          management. Reviews show users find its interface intuitive and the food database large.

          sleep tracking, body measurements, blood pressure/glucose tracking, advanced reports
          and insights, is ad-free, and syncs with devices like smart watches.

        <h3>Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't add back the calories you burned from exercise to your daily allowance.</li>
            <li>Rather than using AI meal scans, log everything individually. While this takes more time, it is far more accurate.</li>
            <li>Buy a food scale. This helps with precise measurements and ensures you meet your goals on your health journey.</li>
            <li>Don't rely on memory. If you eat it, log it right away.</li>
            <li>It’s better to overestimate than underestimate. When eating out, find the meal closest to what you ordered and pick the highest-calorie version for logging.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop meals that you enjoy.</strong> Create a recipe or meal in the app for that specific dish to make tracking easier and faster.</li>
            <li>If you struggle with consistency (arguably the most important part), set small goals for yourself. 
                For example, if you track every day for a month, reward yourself with something you’ve been wanting — like new workout gear or a special treat that motivates you.</li>
